# RETAIL SALES AND CUSTOMER DEMOGRAPHICS REPORT ON POWER BI
## Project overview
This dataset is about a fictional retail landscape, capturing essential attributes that drive retail 
operations and customer interactions. It includes key details such as Transaction ID, Date, Customer ID, 
Gender, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price per Unit, and Total Amount. These attributes enable a 
multifaceted exploration of sales trends, demographic influences, and purchasing behaviour.

## Tools
- Microsoft Power Bi

## Data Preparation
In the initial data preparation, I performed the following tasks using power query;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and formatting


## Business Questions
1. Find the Total Quantity of Product sold 
2. How many are the Product Category?
3. How does customer age and gender influence their purchasing behavior?
4. Are there discernible patterns in sales across different time periods?
5. Which product categories hold the highest appeal among customers?
6. What are the relationships between age, spending, and product preferences?
7. How do customers adapt their shopping habits during seasonal trends, having the season:
Spring (March, April, and May), Summer (June, July, and August) Autumn (September, 
October, and November), Winter (December, January, and February)


## Solutions;
1. three thousand products were sold according to the data set.
2. There are 3 product categories
3.  According to the data set, older females and males above than the age of 46 are more interested in the products sold by the organisation compared to the younger demographics.
4. Yes, there are discernably patterns in seasonal and monthly sales and revenue trends with the highest peaks during the winter season. 
5. The most appealing product category is the electronics while the least appealing is from the beauty products category. This implies that there should be a more appealing marketing strategy for beauty products to increase their sales.
6. The relationship between age, spending, and product preferences reveals that the older demographics are the highest spenders across all categories followed by the adults then the youths. Attention and market research on what appeals more to the youths and adults demographics should be in consideration and incorporated in other to boost sales from the younger demographics.
7. For the customers shopping habits, there is a high number of clothing sales during the spring season which takes a down turn during the other seasons meaning the store doesnt sell clothes suitable for other seasons. Electronics sales peaks through autumn and winter but had a decline in spring and summer due to the reason earlier stated above. Beauty products had low sales all through the seasons which implies that the demographics are not interested or used to the beauty products sold. Solution for this issue might be to introduce beauty products that are popular in that region across all demographics.
